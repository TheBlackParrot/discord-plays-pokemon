### Dependencies
* Discord.py (>=0.10.0-alpha)
* VisualBoyAdvance (WX UI recommended)
* xdotool

This is essentially a Discord wrapper for a couple of `xdotool` commands. This is designed for Pokemon games, but I'm sure many others would work fine too.

[Recommended VBA-M configuration (`~/.vbam/vbam.conf`)](https://gist.github.com/TheBlackParrot/c38240365f565b665a0607f9e0fc3d50)
